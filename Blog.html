<H2>How I started programming</H2>
<div>
<p>
 
  January 17, 2023<br>
  I’ve always been interested in computers and programming. When I was younger, I would spend hours playing around with my computer, looking up new tricks and tips on how to make it work better. I started learning python coding a year ago. From there I spent a few hours here and there learning how to write simple scripts like creating lists of data or printing things out onto paper. However, as time went on and technology advanced so did my skill set—and now I’m able to create websites of my own!
  
  The first programming language that I learned was Python.
  Python is a general-purpose programming language that’s used by Google, Dropbox and IBM. It was designed to be easy to learn and use. Python’s syntax makes it ideal for beginners, who can quickly get up to speed with the basics of coding.
  
  The first programming language that I learned was Python. After learning basic concepts in this language, I started making my own applications by writing code that would do simple tasks .
  
  When I first started, I took an online class at Udemy.com.
  The first thing I did was to take an online class at Udemy.com. There are some free classes, but most of them cost money and you can take your time with them as much or as little as you want. Udemy is a great place to learn programming because they have a lot of different classes for pretty much any topic that interests you!
  
  They have a great website with lots of resources on how to get started with learning programming languages like Python, Ruby and PHP.
  You can find a course for any skill level, from beginner to advanced. There are also courses that teach you how to code in Python, Ruby and PHP.
  

  After the Udemy class, I started looking for resources on the internet. There are many websites with resources on programming, but it’s difficult to find good information and filter out bad information. You need to be able to search for what you want and understand how to search effectively.
  
  Also, most online courses do not have an instructor who can help you if you get stuck or confused by something in the course material (or from someone else’s comments). You need a community of people who are also learning programming so that they can give feedback and help each other when needed!
  
  There are many ways to learn a new skill like programming, it just takes time and dedication!
 
  
  Take online courses. The best way to get started with computer science is through an online course or bootcamp program. The flexibility of this type of learning makes it easy for you to fit in your schedule and complete assignments when you have the time. You can also take classes at night or on weekends so that you don’t feel rushed during the day job (or other responsibilities).
  Learn from others who are already experienced in the field; this will help increase your confidence level when trying out new ideas yourself as well as give insight into what’s working well within the industry at large today.
  Community is key in learning to program – you can’t go it alone!
  
  
  You’ll find communities online that are made up of people who have similar interests and goals to yours (e.g., learning how to code). There are many platforms where you can connect with others: Facebook groups, Twitter chats, Reddit forums…and more! It’s easy for us as humans to feel isolated when we’re learning something new—but don’t worry about isolating yourself from people who share your passion for programming; instead ask questions! It’s about building friendships through shared experiences like creating apps or writing programs together.
  
  This is just a taste of what you can learn about programming by taking an online course. There are many other resources available as well, including books and classes at local colleges or universities. In fact, there are even free courses on Udemy which give you the chance to learn from scratch! If none of these seem like your cup of tea, then keep reading here at Loading Melo where we’ll help guide you through the process step by step!</p>
